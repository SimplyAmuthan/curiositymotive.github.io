Lover of Music, Technology, Art and the places in between. Developer <a href="https://twitter.com/lessonly" target="_blank">@lessonly</a>. In the past I could have been labeled a Flash Developer, today I might be called a Web Developer and tomorrow… only time will tell. The people who matter will know exactly what I do from this one word and those who don’t will think I’m in real estate.
