Alex is an interactive developer and artist. He likes making inanimate objects do weird things like light up, make noise, and talk to the internet. Heâ€™s equally happy holding a keyboard, a soldering iron, a game controller, or a paintbrush, and makes sure to switch that up from time to time. Primarily focusing on the interfaces between person and machine, interactive art, IOT, and game development are his primary passions of the moment.
