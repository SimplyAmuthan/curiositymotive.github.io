Justin just wants everything to work better together than it did yesterday that helps ship some thing more awesome than the previous thing. Childhood cartoonist dreams led him to coding through animation. More complex projects led him to enjoy lining up all of the various pieces for rockstars as an Interactive Producer at <a href="http://bamide.as/" target="_blank">Bradley and Montgomery</a>. He also tries to find the game in all things and is the founder of <a href="http://www.horriblenight.com/" target="_blank">HorribleNight.com</a>.
