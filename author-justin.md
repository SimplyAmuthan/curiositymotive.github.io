Justin just wants everything to work better together than it did yesterday so that something more awesome than the last thing gets shipped. Childhood cartoonist dreams led him to animation through coding and eventually lining up all the pieces of complex projects as an Interactive Producer at <a href="http://bamide.as/" target="_blank">Bradley and Montgomery</a>. He tries to find the game in all things and is the founder of <a href="http://www.horriblenight.com/" target="_blank">HorribleNight.com</a>.
